#Interactive Installer â€“ Build a script that installs packages and configures a system
# A interactive installer is a Bash Script that: 
#   1. Asks the user which packages or tools they want to install.
#   2. Installs them using a package manager (apt, yum, dnf, pacman, bew, etc)
#   3. Optionally configures things afterwars (e.g., editing config files, enabling services, setting aliases)
#   4. Provides feedback and handles errors interactively

packages=("git" "curl" "vim" "htop" "docker.io")

    # [[ ... ]] is Bash conditional expression syntax  
    # we are comparing values this way is safer and easier
